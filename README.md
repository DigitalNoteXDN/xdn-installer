# xdn-installer
Bash script for installing DigitalNote masternode and wallets for Linux 16.x and 18.x

To compile wallets:
```
sudo -i
git clone https://github.com/rubber-duckie-au/xdn-installer.git
cd xdn-installer
sudo bash xdn-installer.sh
```
Select option 3.
NB If you do not want to recreate a new DigitlaNote.conf file after the compile, press ```<crtl> + <c>``` to terminate the script when it asks you to enter an RPC user name.
